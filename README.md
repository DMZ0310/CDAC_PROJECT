# 🎙️ Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) using Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is the process of identifying human emotions from speech signals. Human voice carries rich emotional information through tone, pitch, intensity, and rhythm. By leveraging deep learning techniques, this project aims to automatically detect emotions from speech audio data.

This repository contains the implementation of a **Speech Emotion Recognition classifier** trained on multiple benchmark emotional speech datasets.

## 🧠 What is Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)?

Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is the task of recognizing human emotions and affective states from speech. It is based on the observation that emotional states influence speech patterns such as pitch, speed, energy, and spectral features.

Interestingly, this is similar to how animals like dogs and horses interpret human emotions through voice cues.

## ❓ Why Speech Emotion Recognition?

Emotion recognition is a rapidly growing area in speech and audio analytics. Its applications span multiple real-world domains:

### 🔹 Call Center Analytics
- Classify customer calls based on emotional state
- Identify dissatisfied or frustrated customers
- Measure customer satisfaction and agent performance
- Improve service quality and customer experience

### 🔹 Automotive Safety Systems
- Monitor the emotional and mental state of drivers
- Detect stress, anger, or fatigue
- Trigger safety mechanisms to prevent accidents

### 🔹 Human–Computer Interaction
- Build emotionally aware virtual assistants
- Enhance conversational AI systems

### 🔹 Healthcare & Mental Health
- Assist in detecting emotional disorders
- Monitor patient emotional well-being
